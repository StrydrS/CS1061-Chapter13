What does it mean when you use the final modifier for a method?


When you use the final modifier for a method in Java, 
it means that the method cannot be overridden or redefined 
by subclasses. In other words, a final method is considered
 "immutable" in terms of method overriding.

 - Prevents overriding 
 - fixed behavior, method will not change
 - performance optimization, compiler knows
 method cannot be overwritten and behavior is fixed
