Suppose that you have three classesâ€”HomeInsurance (insurance for a
home), InsurancePolicy (insurance for anything), and FloodDamageInsurance
(insurance for flood damage to a home). Assume that the three classes form an
inheritance hierarchy. Describe the inheritance relationships that exist between classes.
For each relationship, specify the superclass and subclass.

Answer: 
The inheritance hierarchy for the three classes is determined by the purpose of each class.
At the top of the hierarchy, the superclass InsurancePolicy is the first class. It is the parent to 
HomeInsurance, which is the child in this relationship. The insurance policy is the overall policy of the user,
and home insurance is a type of insurance that you can buy under the insurance policy. Again, HomeInsurance is the
parent of the FloodDamageInsurance, and flood damage insurance is the child of HomeInsurance. FloodDamageInsurance is a 
type of home insurance that you can purchase.
