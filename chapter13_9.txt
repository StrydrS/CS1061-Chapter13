What does it mean when you use the final modifier for a class?

When you use the final modifier for a class in Java, 
it means that the class cannot be subclassed or extended by 
other classes. In other words, a final class is considered 
"immutable" in terms of inheritance.

- Prevents inheritance
- Immutable class
- performance optimization as compiler knows it 
cannot be subclassed by another class
