The problem that occurs when the provided printThis method executes
 is that it causes infinite recursion, leading to a StackOverflowError. 
This happens because the subclass's printThis method calls itself recursively 
without any base case or termination condition, leading to an endless loop of method calls.

Here's how to fix it: 

public void printThis(String str) {
    System.out.println("In this subclass's printThis method");
    super.printThis(str); // Call superclass's printThis method
}
